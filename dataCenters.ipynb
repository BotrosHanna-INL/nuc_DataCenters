    "- A journal paper evaluating <u>the economic threshold points</u> identifying the conditions under which user requirements would be better suited by a large, small, or micro-reactor. The use case will be focused on data centers and will provide INL with the credential to stake a claim as a leader in nuclear for data center research.\n",

    "- With a framework on hand, the lab could then leverage its expertise to offer advisory support for the various data centers considering nuclear energy. Further, with interest growing in this area, it is possible that DOE-NE would sponsor research on coupling nuclear reactors with data centers. INL would be well positioned to lead such R&D activities.\n",
